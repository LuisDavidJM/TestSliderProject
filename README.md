## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- bxSlider plugin

### What I learned

In this project I learned to integrate a pack of icons that are imported through a url with the link tag, also to include a javascript plugin which allows you to make a slider in a simple way, only using specific classes and entering the images in a list , finally I learned how to make cls layouts using float to move the content.

### Continued development

Something that can be developed is to include more subs to make a fully functional navbar with redirection, in addition to applying a little more styles with media queries so that it adapts better to mobile devices.
